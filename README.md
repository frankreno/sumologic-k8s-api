# sumologic-k8s-api
Dockerized python script to extract information from the Kubernetes API and forward to SumoLogic.

## Usage

This script can be run standalone or as a container.  A Dockerfile has been provided should you wish to enhance.  An example deployment YAML has also been provided.

### Create a hosted collector and HTTP source in Sumo

In this step you create, on the Sumo service, an HTTP endpoint to receive your logs. This process involves creating an HTTP source on a hosted collector in Sumo. In Sumo, collectors use sources to receive data.

1. If you donâ€™t already have a Sumo account, you can create one by clicking the **Free Trial** button on https://www.sumologic.com/.
2. Create a hosted collector, following the instructions on [Configure a Hosted Collector](https://help.sumologic.com/Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors/Configure-a-Hosted-Collector) in Sumo help. (If you already have a Sumo hosted collector that you want to use, skip this step.)  
3. Create an HTTP source on the collector you created in the previous step. For instructions, see [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source](https://help.sumologic.com/Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source) in Sumo help. 
4. When you have configured the HTTP source, Sumo will display the URL of the HTTP endpoint. Make a note of the URL. You will use it when you configure the script to send data to Sumo. 

### Deploy the script as you want to
The script can be configured with the following environment variables:

| Variable            | Description                                            | Required | DEFAULT VALUE |
| --------            | -----------                                            | -------- | ------------- |
| `SUMO_HTTP_URL`     | The URL for the HTTP source created in the first step. | YES      |               |
| `K8S_API_URL`       | The URL for the Kubernetes API                         | YES      |               | 
| `X-Sumo-Name`       | Desired source name.                                   | NO       |               | 
| `X-Sumo-Host`       | Desired host name.                                     | NO       |               | 
| `X-Sumo-Category`   | Desired source category.                               | NO       |               | 
### Run On Node

You can simply add the script to one of your nodes and set it up via crontab.  However, if the node dies so does your script unless baked into the image.

### Run As CronJob

Example cronjob files has been provided. If you are using RBAC, you should use the `sumologic-k8s-api-cronjob-rbac.yaml`, other wise you can use `sumologic-k8s-api-cronjob.yaml`. This cronjob runs a sidecar container that starts `kubectl proxy` with the default port of 8001.  The cronjob has a default schedule of running every 5 minutes, you can tune as needed.  The `K8S_API_URL` variable has been set based on the `kubectl` sidecar container.

## Running The CronJob in a different Namespace

The current YAML configuration assumes you are going to run the CronJob in the default namespace.  If you plan to run it in a different namespace, you need to update the [ClusterRoleBinding](https://github.com/frankreno/sumologic-k8s-api/blob/master/sumologic-k8s-api-cronjob-rbac.yaml#L58) to indicate what Namespace you wish to run.

## Common Errors

### SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED

This CronJob runs `kubectl proxy` in a side car container, which allows the script to communicate with the API Server over `localhost`.  You should need to change the `K8S_API_URL` in most cases.  If you are getting this error, ensure you leave `K8S_API_URL` as the default value.

### Unable to access the API, forbidden error messages

This likely means you are running the CronJob in a namespace other than `default`, see the above section on the changes needed to run the CronJob in a different namespace.
